A private chat application with camera feature that allows to edit photos. 
This idea came soon after "Messenger" had to comply with EU regulations on data collection.
Photo editing even simple ones like cropping were removed since pictures and chat history data was stored on Facebook servers and sold to advertisers.
"Private" part came after we were joking in our group chat about everybody.
chipping in for a waterpark slide and 2 days later getting an actual advertisement for a waterpark slide from Whish.com for 700000 USD.
Idea is that if the data is stored on individual devices, meaning that not even chat members can access the data of a user that is offline.
This should in theory comply with EU regulation on data collection.

This application must have a log in function.
Must have camera feature in the chat.
Pictures must editable before sending them.

Application should allow group chats.
Should allow to set nicknames.
Data (chats, pictures) should be stored on individual device.
Should have notifications.

Application could have color filter options for camera.
Could work in offline mode.
Could have advertisement bars for sustainability.
Could have video option on camera side.

Will not have cloud storage.
Will not have chat history of an offline user.
Will not have face filter (ex. snapchat dog filter)
